# Changelog

Overall didn't really change much other than some padding and introducing the snow effects. I didn't set aside enough time to actually add in all the changes I wanted to including parallax scrolling, mouse location highlighting, and raining potato chips.

1. I added the snow effects but this was stolen straight from (codepen.io)[https://codepen.io/massiebn/pen/OJMbXz]
2. Added github stats
